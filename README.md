# Teensy 2.0 LED Shield

Back in 2010 I happened to get my first hands-on experience with micro-controllers and the first one happened to be a [Teensy 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/). I built this little shield for the main purpose to figure out using [EaglePCB](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) software and also play around with different pins on the Teensy board.
